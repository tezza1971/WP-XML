This folder will be a repository for a range of schema that apply to the XAO 
framework. For instance, SQL definition files will be stored here to build 
RDBMS objects required by some of the cache/logging drivers. There will also 
be XML schema applying to the XAO namespace (tags generated by the framework).
This will include tag definitions for exceptions and XSL params etc. It will 
also include XSD modules for user-oriented files supported by the framework -
ie. the request map, and configuration files.
